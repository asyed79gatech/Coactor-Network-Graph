# Coactor Network Graph Visualization
Vast amount of digital data is generated every day, but raw data is often not immediately usable. We are usually more interested in the information content of the data, what pattens are captured?

This repository showcases a project aimed at collecting, preprocessing, and visualizing data using an API from The Movie Database (TMDB) and constructing a graph representation of the data which shows how prolific each actor is and which actors have acted together. The undirected network graph visualization highlights connections between nodes (actors) using D3.js, providing an engaging way to explore relationships and data patterns.
